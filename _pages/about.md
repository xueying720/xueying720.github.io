I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University, supervised by Prof. [Lawrence Kim](https://www.lhkim.com/). I am affiliated with [Tangent Lab](https://tangent.cs.sfu.ca/) and [Interactive Experiences Lab (ixLab)](https://ixlab.cs.sfu.ca/).

Prior to this, I worked as a product designer in Toronto. I hold a Master’s degree in Design Informatics from the University of Edinburgh and a Bachelor’s degree in Internet of Things Engineering from Beijing University of Technology.

My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, tangible user interfaces, inclusive design, and health and wellbeing.
